# Microsoft Security Incident Prediction Model

## Overview
This project presents a machine learning model developed to predict and classify cybersecurity incidents using the Microsoft Security Incident Prediction dataset. The model is designed to help Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by automating incident triage and prioritization, improving response time, and increasing operational efficiency.

The Microsoft Security Incident Prediction dataset provides a large set of labeled cybersecurity incidents with triage categories, enabling predictive analytics for SOC optimization. This model classifies incidents into three primary categories:
- **True Positive (TP)**: Actual threats that require attention.
- **Benign Positive (BP)**: Non-malicious events flagged as potential threats.
- **False Positive (FP)**: Non-malicious events that should be ignored.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps for data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling class imbalance.
- **Model Training**: Selection of models, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation strategies.
- **Model Evaluation**: Key metrics used, including Precision, Recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **Error Analysis**: Analysis of misclassified incidents to identify improvement areas.

## Model Details
- **Models Used**: This project experimented with several algorithms, including [mention key models you used, e.g., Random Forest, LightGBM, etc.].
- **Feature Engineering**: Custom features derived from alert attributes, user behaviors, and incident metadata.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Emphasis on metrics that balance precision and recall to minimize false positives without missing critical incidents.



## Results
A summary of model performance and insights gained, with visualizations (confusion matrix, feature importance, etc.) to illustrate the model's classification capabilities.
