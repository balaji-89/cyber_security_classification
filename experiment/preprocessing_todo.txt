## TODO: 
#Target Column: IncidentGrade - First drop the entire rows that has null values and Just label encode this. Also handle class imbalance

#ID, #AlertId: group IDs based on Target variable and either use the counts or use (0,1,2) for the categories respectively
     and for new ID's assign -1 value for others and . (relation : one to one )

#DetectorId : relation (one to many). Use the counts to encode the data, and consider counts less than 5000 as others category (0.036%)

#OrgId: relation (one to many). Use the counts to encode the data, and consider counts less than 5000 as others category (0.005%)
#Timestamp : Create separate columns for day, drop the rest timestamp (month, year didn't add anything to the target value) also add hour minutes info
#AlertTitle : Create a "others" category for lower than 5000(0.05%) counts and replace values with the counts and finally normalize
#Category:  OHE before doing that create a new group "others" by aggregating the category together which have total count less than 5000 (0.05%)
#EntityType: create a other category which counts are less than 10000 (0.01%) and do OHE.
#EvidenceRole : Just do label encode this, have only two categories.
#DeviceId, Sha256, Url, IpAddress, AccountSid, AccountUpn,AccountObjectId,AccountName,DeviceName,NetworkMessageId, 
                    ApplicationId, ApplicationName, FileName, FolderPath, OSVersion, CountryCode, State, City
                 : The columns are skewed too much, mark the most repeated one as -2 , create "others" categories aggregating categories where total count is less than
                    0.1% . and finally replace column with counts and normalize the columns

#OSFamily: Has only 4 or 5 Categories so use OHE






#Dropping Columns: 
### IncidentId: Because ID and OrgId gives the informations of this IncidentId detail
### ActionGrouped: Drop the column has too many null values
### ActionGranular: Drop the column has too many null values
### MitreTechniques : Drop the column has too many null values
### EmailClusterId : Drop the column has too many null values
### LastVerdict : ''
### SuspicionLevel : '
### AntispamDirection : ''
### Roles : ''
### ThreatFamily : ''
### ResourceType : ''  
### RegistryValueName : The data skewed to much
### RegistryKey, RegistryValueData, OAuthApplicationId, ResourceIdName



#Yet to decide: 





#Skipped Features: 
All IDs
